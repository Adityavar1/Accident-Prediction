# Accident-Prediction
Analyzed the US accidents dataset(1.1GB) to attempt to predict zones posing potentially severe accident hazards.Feature engineered and balanced the dataset using under-sampling and synthetic over-sampling techniques.	Implemented and tuned classification algorithms with gridsearchCV to get an optimized accuracy of 84%.
